**Random thoughts/tech gists/reflections and ..redemptions**. Geek style.
Ordinary or extraordinary .. we will see. 

I have been inspired. Overwhelmingly inspired. By people, their ideas, their motivation, their creativity and their results. 
And you thought that this was a good thing. To a large extent, yes. In this whole process I got bitten by this bug, that has been forcing me to do a few projects of my own. For profit and for fun. 

My project list kept growing. It will be wrong to say that I didn't do anything about these projects.On the contrary - I tried reading up on a few, watched videos, downloaded pdfs (more than I could ever read). Tried other people's code. Wrote some code of my own. 

But my project list did not move. And once in a while there is this unknow force that seizes me and talks to me and says "you need to finish them and I will not leave you until you do"

This blog is a humble beginning trying to learn, document and explain some of the things I have read along and found interesting. More importantly, I am hoping this will bring in a discipline in me to stay focussed, use the learnings in my projects and yes, more importantly share my learnings. 

As they say - the journey of a thousand miles starts with a step. So here I am starting with a blog. 
Nothing fancy..
